In today’s competitive fast-food industry, understanding customer behavior, product performance, and revenue patterns is crucial to staying ahead—and for a pizza business, this insight is non-negotiable. The 𝐏𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚-𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐩𝐞 2015 𝐀𝐧𝐧𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 was conducted to provide a clear picture of how various pizzas performed throughout the year and to guide strategic decisions that align with customer demand and market dynamics.

𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲
The analysis was carried out using 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈, beginning with the 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 2015 𝐩𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭. The dataset included key variables such as pizza names, categories, sizes, order quantities, prices, and timestamps. Initial data cleaning involved checking for duplicates, correcting inconsistent labels, and ensuring proper formatting of dates and categorical fields.
A dynamic dashboard was developed using a variety of visualizations:
•	𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐬 to display KPIs (e.g., total revenue, best pizza, most purchased size)
•	𝐁𝐚𝐫 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐢𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬 to analyze sales by size, category, and quantity
•	𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐞-𝐦𝐚𝐩𝐬 to identify top-performing pizza names
•	𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬 to visualize monthly sales trends
•	𝐒𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐬 to enable interactive filtering by pizza name and size

𝐎𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬

1. 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
Total revenue for 2015 was $815,000, indicating a profitable year.
Revenue trends show fluctuations across months, but three months (Jan, Mar, Jul) reached 𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐤 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 $71𝐊. Despite some dips, monthly revenues generally remained strong, rarely falling below $64K.

2. 𝐏𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚 𝐒𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
𝐋𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐩𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚𝐬 dominated both in quantity sold (19𝐊 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐬) and revenue ($$375𝐊 𝐨𝐫 47% of total sales).
𝐌𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐮𝐦 𝐬𝐢𝐳𝐞 followed with 15𝐊 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐝 and $248𝐊 in sales revenue (31%).
𝐒𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐩𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚𝐬 were the least sold (14𝐊 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐬, $177𝐊 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞), but still held a meaningful share.

3. 𝐏𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬
𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐢 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐏𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚 was the best-selling product with 44𝐊 𝐢𝐧 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬, showing strong customer preference.
𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐫𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐏𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐚 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐏𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚 closely followed with 43𝐊 𝐚𝐧𝐝 42𝐊 respectively.
Products like 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐮𝐱𝐞 𝐏𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚 (38𝐊) 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐧 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐏𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚 (35𝐊) also performed well but showed room for improvement.

4. 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬
𝐉𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐲, 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐉𝐮𝐥𝐲 were the highest-performing months, each bringing in $71𝐊 in sales.
𝐅𝐞𝐛𝐫𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 had the lowest revenue months, both falling to $64𝐊, potentially due to post-holiday or off-peak seasons.
A mid-year dip in 𝐌𝐚𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 suggests possible seasonal demand shifts or operational constraints.

5. 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐲-𝐖𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞

The performance gap between categories suggests varying popularity and could guide inventory or marketing focus.
